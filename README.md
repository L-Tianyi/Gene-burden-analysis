# [MSc project] Gene Burden Analysis in Exome-sequencing Data

This directory contains the code for a MSc project about gene burden analysis. 

The file "SimulatingGenotypeMatrix.R" are the code for section 3.1 and 4.1 of the project. 
These sections perform principal component analysis for some simulated genotype matrices.

The file "SKATchr22.R" contains the code for section 3.2 and 4.2. 
These two sections perform association analysis for an exome-sequencing data of chromosome 22. "SKAT" is used to perform the association analysis

The file "FECD_CaseControl.R" contains the code for section 3.3 and 4.3
The code for a Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD) case-control study. "SKAT" is used to perform the association analysis.
